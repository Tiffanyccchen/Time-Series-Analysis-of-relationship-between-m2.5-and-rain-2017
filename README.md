## Introduction

The analysis processes and results are explained in 時序報告.pdf  
* Data
  * Time : 2007 - 2016
  * Unit : Monthly Average

## Structure
1. pm2.5_final.R :   
  pm2.5 time series model building and forecasting  
  
2. rain_final.R :   
  rain time series model building and forecasting   
  
3. pm2.5_rain_cor.R :    
  correlation between pm2.5 and rain after buiiding time series models   
  (Only after removing time effect, the correlation will be accurate)
